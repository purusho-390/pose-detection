## Introduction

Pose detection is the process of detecting human figures in images or video feeds. This project uses OpenCV for image processing and MediaPipe for pose estimation. Google Colab is utilized to provide a cloud-based environment for running the code.

## Features

- Real-time pose detection
- Uses MediaPipe's Pose solution for high accuracy
- Easy to run on Google Colab with minimal setup

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have access to Google Colab. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone github.com/purusho-390/pose-detection
    cd pose-detection
    ```

2. Open the `pose_detection.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```python
    !pip install opencv-python mediapipe
    ```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository** and **open the notebook** in Google Colab.
2. **Install dependencies** as shown in the notebook.
3. **Run the cells** in the notebook to see pose detection in action.
